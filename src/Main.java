/**
 * DESIGN PRINCIPLES
 * -----------------
 * Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
 * Program to an interface, not an implementation.
 * Favor composition over inheritance.
 * Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
 * Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
 * Depend upon abstractions, do not depend upon concrete classes.
